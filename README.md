# Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:
+ How to serve a TensorFlow model with TensorFlow serving and Docker.
+ How to create a minimal flask application to create an interface to the served model.
By the end of this course, you will be able to deploy your own TensorFlow models with TensorFlow Serving, and will be able to create simple web applications with Flask to serve as an interface to the served models.

# Step by Step
Now we will deploy a TensorFlow model with TensorFlow Serving and Flask. We will accomplish it in by completing each task in the project:
+ Task 1: Introduction
+ Task 2: Getting Started with the Flask App
+ Task 3: Index Template
+ Task 4: TensorFlow Serving
+ Task 5: Getting Predictions
+ Task 6: Connecting the Model Server to the App
+ Task 7: Displaying the Results in the App
